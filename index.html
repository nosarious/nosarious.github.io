           A Part of a Whole depicts an imagined built landscape of buildings that exist only when one is viewing the remains of an abandones townssite. The shadows are presented within suitcases representing those who inhabited this town with shadows visible only with a moving light.

           Bankhead, Revisited explores the sharing of my curiosity while exploring an abandoned townsite with the viewer. It comprises several grouped prints made from 3d scans on the site, and a moving light source creating a shadow which implies the path of curiosity.

          Walls: Retaining Memory proposes the concept that walls collect the experiences that occur around them, presented in the form of small house-shaped 'books' with stories enfolded within them, as well as walls that can be reconstructed into houses with memories.

          Reduced to a Rumor explores the fading of specifics of identity from detail, to rumor and folklore, presented as an installation where figures appear in photographs of degraded spaces and slowly lose detail until they are shapes that eventually disappear from view.
