		      <p><b>Research</b> is what I call the projects which have not progressed to completed artworks. There are some, such as the <b>Publishing Engine</b>, which may never become a part of my art practice, and others such as <b>Hexagons</b> which are intended to test a personal theory.</p>

			<p><a href= "hexagons_not_squares.html"><b>Hexagons, not Squares</b></a> was an exploration in how hexagons might be more visually interesting than just grid renditions when scanning people for portraits.</p>
