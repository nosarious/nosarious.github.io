      <p><b>Research</b> is what I call the projects which have not progressed to completed artworks. There are some, such as the <b>Publishing Engine</b>, which may never become a part of my art practice, and others such as <b>Hexagons</b> which are intended to test a personal theory.</p>
      
      <p><b>Contour, not Meshes</b> is an attempt to make clearer representations of scanned areas for copper plate printing.</p>
      <p><b>Topography for Imagination</b> considers replacing the glass in <b>A Part of a Whole</b> with a better representation of the landscape than a flat peice of textured glass.</p>
      <p><b>Paths of Curiosity</b> is a concept used for recording the exploration of abandoned spaces using GPS and environmental sensors. This information is used for making visual mnemonics for recollecting experiences afterwards..</p>
      <p><b>Stacked Imagery</b> reconsiders the viewpoint of traditional phtoography. Instead of the single vantage a photographer shares, what about a more comprehensive set whowing mulitple heights?</p>
      <p><b>Showing Past Presence</b> is a prelude to Reduced to a Rumour. When you kknow people inhabited or visited a space, how do you represent that fact without building a specific charicature?</p>
      <p><b>Publishing Engine</b> was an attempt to make it possible for everyone to create single-page magazines for tablet computers. Abandoned since 2015.</p>
      <p><b>Hexagons, not Squares</b> was an exploration in how hexagons might be more visually interesting than just grid renditions when scanning people for portraits.</p>
      <p><b>Tracking Bodies</b>
      
      
      
			<p><b>Experiments</b> are what I refer to work that was informative for creative research but did not become a final body of work. These pieces are experimental and are part of the exploratory process towards a final art work or style of disemmnation.

			 <p><b>Plotting and Printing</b> An important part of Bankhead, Revisited was the copperr-plate prints made from wireframe meshes of scanned areas in the Upper Bankhead townsite. This experimental process of using contour lines, an Axidraw plotter and potential 3D printing is to explore ways of representing the landscape as it was visited.</p>
			 <p>These processes will be further refined and presented with the same conceptual basis as the copper plate prints: vantages of spaces that are presented as puzzles to be visually intriguing, to trigger the imagination of the viewer without as much information as a simple photograph would be.</p>

           A Part of a Whole depicts an imagined built landscape of buildings that exist only when one is viewing the remains of an abandones townssite. The shadows are presented within suitcases representing those who inhabited this town with shadows visible only with a moving light.

           Bankhead, Revisited explores the sharing of my curiosity while exploring an abandoned townsite with the viewer. It comprises several grouped prints made from 3d scans on the site, and a moving light source creating a shadow which implies the path of curiosity.

          Walls: Retaining Memory proposes the concept that walls collect the experiences that occur around them, presented in the form of small house-shaped 'books' with stories enfolded within them, as well as walls that can be reconstructed into houses with memories.

          Reduced to a Rumor explores the fading of specifics of identity from detail, to rumor and folklore, presented as an installation where figures appear in photographs of degraded spaces and slowly lose detail until they are shapes that eventually disappear from view.

          The Archives Project is an ongoing work that examines the changing role of photography for myself, going from a personal recolletion to a edited trendition onto a shared experience and, finally, a sense that the mass and potential of photographs means more than the individual pictures themselves.
