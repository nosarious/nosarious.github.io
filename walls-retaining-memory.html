			<p><b>Walls: Retaining Memory</b> examines the nature of the experiences of living on a homestead or in an abandoned town from the remaining walls. It is based off two phrases: <i>What if these walls could talk</i> and <i>You can't tell the book by it's cover</i>. It is inspired from standing in a ruined structure and imagining how the space was used.</p>
			<p>This work is presented as a series of small house-shaped boxes displayed on folding card tables with occassional folding chairs available. In another room is a table with numerous shapes based off the walls, gables and roofs of these house-shaped boxes. The dimansion of the boxes is similar to the simple grainaries used on farms. A small, sturdy structure that is sometimes the last to collapse because of their strentgh needed for the original use.</p>
			<p>This work was originally presented in the emptied store location of the Fine Arts Department at the University of Calgary, chosen for it's resemblance to a tired downstairs meeting space in a community center or church.</p> 
			<p>This work considers the experiences of living on a site as being similar to a liquid, pooling around the remaining surfcaces and staining them with the moments of a lifetime. As an explorer of abandones spaces I try to imagine the way they were used through interpreting the scars, marks and modifications on the walls.</p>
			<p>The small house-shaped objects can be opened, their interior showing a landscape, photographic hints and typed text, as well as a floorplan of the original farm house. They can be closed back again due to hidden magnets and strips of metal.</p>
			<p>The collection of walls, gables and roofs are covered with images and designs, and can be rebuilt into houses because they also incorporate magnets. They are a chance to find images and designs that rekindle personal memories to recreate lost homes.</p>
			<p>This work is part of a body of work that explores my relationship to the abandoned and forgotten inhabieted spaces remaining from the Homestead Era in Canada.</p>
