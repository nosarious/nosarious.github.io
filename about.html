	 	<p><b>BFA</b> from the Alberta College of Art and Design in Media Arts and Digital Technologies.</p>
	 	<p><b>MSc</b> in Computing Science from the University of Calagry in Computational Media Design.</p>
	 	<p>Currently he is completing a Masters in Fine Arts, dedicated to content-before-code, where the art is supported by digital technologies as opposed to developing code before an art idea. The thematic work of his degree is centered around the early homesteaders and vanished villages of rural Canada, and discovering alternative methods for demonstrating the personal feeling of being in abandoned spaces where people lived and worked through artwork.</p>
