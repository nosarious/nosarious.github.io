		<p><b>Bankhead: Revisited</b> is an artwork exploring the sharing of my curiosity while exploring an abandoned townsite with the viewer. It comprises several grouped prints made from 3d scans on the site, and a moving light source creating a shadow which implies the path of curiosity.</p>

    <p>The Bankhead Townsite in Banff National Park was dismantled in the 30's after the coal mine had been running for 20 years. The houses were moved to various towns, mostly banff and Canmore. Most industrial buildings & machiners from Lower Bankhead were taken to the Corwsnest Pass and the mine in Canmore.</p>
		<p><b>Grouped Images.</b>The printss are arrannged according to streets, Rundle, Aylmer and Cascade. They also correspond to the amount of foundations left. Some are exposed (Rundle) some are overgrown (Aylmer) and some streets (Cascade) did not have basements, leaving only holes behind.</p>
    <p>These images are also defined by the printing process, where there are distinct outlines degrading slowly to vague representations of the places that were scanned. The print process was copper plate, exposed photo emulsion followed by acid etching. The aesthetic nature of the print technique is an important part of the work.

	 	<p><b>Walls: Retaining Memory</b> is a project that explores the concept that walls collect the memories of experiences that occur around them, presented in the form of small house-shaped 'books' with stories enfolded within them, as well as walls that can be reconstructed into houses with memories.</p>

	 	<p><b>Reduced to a Rumor</b> is a recognition that we understand there were people who once lived or worked in certain locations, but we do not know, or need to know, who those people were. Presented in an installation composed of a specific arrangement of furniture, screen and constructed digital installation that mimics mannequins devolving into shapes on a landscape, Reduced to a Rumor explores the fading of specifics of identity from detail, to rumor and folklore.</p>
