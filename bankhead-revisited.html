		<p><b>Bankhead: Revisited</b> is an artwork exploring the sharing of my curiosity while exploring an abandoned townsite with the viewer. It comprises several grouped prints made from 3d scans on the site, and a moving light source creating a shadow which implies the path of curiosity.</p>

    		<p>The Bankhead Townsite in Banff National Park was dismantled in the 30's after the coal mine had been running for 20 years. The houses were moved to various towns, mostly banff and Canmore. Most industrial buildings & machiners from Lower Bankhead were taken to the Corwsnest Pass and the mine in Canmore.</p>
		<p><b>Grouped Images.</b>The printss are arrannged according to streets, Rundle, Aylmer and Cascade. They also correspond to the amount of foundations left. Some are exposed (Rundle) some are overgrown (Aylmer) and some streets (Cascade) did not have basements, leaving only holes behind.</p>

	 	<img class = "imageholder-sm" src = "images/industry-gables.JPG">
	 	<p>These images are also defined by the printing process, where there are distinct outlines degrading slowly to vague representations of the places that were scanned. The print process was copper plate, exposed photo emulsion followed by acid etching. The aesthetic nature of the print technique is an important part of the work.

	 	<p>An important part of Bankhead, Revisited is the shadows which play along the far wall. The galler is dark except for lights targetting the grouped images and the statement for the installation. Along one wall a moving light source casts shadows through a crumpled screen, implying the path of curiousity which was taken while exploring the Bankhead townsite. There are two seats available for people to sit while watching the shadows move along the entire length of the wall. During the creation of htis work I explored the landscape of Bankhead, allowing only my curiousity to guide my way.</p>
