			<p><b>A Part of a Whole</b> consists of a series of suitcases arranged through a gallery on stands, opened and with glass covering the bottom where clothes would normally be. At any one time a single suitcase will have a light travelling through it, casting shadows of buildings on the glass. The glass is covered with a tissue paper that is poorly applied, sometimes torn, patched and stained. There are no wires to any of the suitcases, allowing a visitor to walk around eacch one.</p>
			<p>This work is inspired by reflection on an earlier work, Bankhead, Revisited. This earlier work explored the remains of an abandoned townsite to share the experience of discovery within these locations. <b>A Part of a Whole</b> shares the imaginary rebuilding of such a site, showcased within an empathy for those people who once inhabited the space.</p>
			<p>The mine and townsite fo Bankhead, Alberta is a case study for these two artworks and consists of foundations, paths that used to be streets, meadows and piles of dark soil from the mining process. A unique part of it's status is the accessibility to the public and recorded history of the town and mine itself. You can have picnics among the foundations that remain, which are crumbled and overgrown with trees. This ability to walk around them is an important part of the choice for using wireless suitcases in this artwork.</p>
